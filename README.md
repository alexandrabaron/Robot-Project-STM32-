## **Specifications**
As part of the project, our pair was awarded contract number 3. The objective 
is as follows: after the start command, the robot must obey 2 Bluetooth commands from the 
tablet: move forward and turn right. The robot can only turn if the forward command has been 
done. A second press on advance stops the robot. When the robot moves forward, the command 
turning increases the rotation angle by 45 degrees for each press. A prolonged press on 
spinning rotates the robot in place. In all cases, the robot advances after the 
rotation. To stop it there are two solutions: emergency stop button B1 or a second press 
on move forward.
